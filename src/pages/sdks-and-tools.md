## Example apps

### XMTP Quickstart Chat app repo

An example React chat app you can use as a developer tool to learn how to build a basic messaging app using the XMTP client SDK. The app is intentionally streamlined and unopinionated, making it a good quickstart launching point for building with XMTP. You can customize and deploy the app if you want to.
