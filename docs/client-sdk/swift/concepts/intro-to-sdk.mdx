# Introduction to the XMTP client SDK for Swift

The [XMTP client SDK for Swift](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js) is a Swift implementation of an XMTP client for use with iOS apps.

When you build an app with XMTP, you can use the following functions provided by the SDK:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Key pair generation | Create XMTP keys used for message signing and encryption and advertising public keys to the network. |
| Key storage | Store XMTP keys securely. |
| Key signing | Sign XMTP keys using a connected wallet app. |
| Relationship initiation | Create a secure messaging relationship between two accounts. |
| Conversation initiation | Create a container of messages between two accounts. |
| Message sending | Capture plaintext and submit it to the network. |
| Message history retrieval | Retrieve the history of messages between two accounts, filterable by date range. |
| Message streaming | Receive new messages in real-time. |
| Message authentication | Validate messages are from their purported sender. |
| Message format validation | Ensure messages are properly formatted for the XMTP network. |
