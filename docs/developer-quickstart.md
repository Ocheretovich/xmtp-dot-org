# Developer Quickstart

Check out the replit live code example:

- [Replit Live Example](https://replit.com/@FabrizioGuespe/XMTP-Developer-Quickstart?v=1)

### Get started

```jsx
npm install @xmtp/xmtp-js ethers@5.7.0 qrcode-terminal
```

### Import libraries

To start with XMTP, install the XMTP client SDK:

```jsx
const { Wallet } = require("ethers");
const { Client } = require("@xmtp/xmtp-js");
```

### Initialize the wallet

You'll want to replace this with a wallet from your application

```jsx
// You'll want to replace this with a wallet from your application
const wallet = Wallet.createRandom();
console.log("Wallet address: " + wallet.address);
```

### Create a client

A client is created that requires passing in a connected wallet that implements the Signer interface. Use client configuration options to change parameters of a client's network connection.

```jsx
const xmtp = await Client.create(wallet, { env: "dev" });
console.log(xmtp);
console.log("Client created", xmtp.address);
```

### Check if an address is on the network

First you need to check if the address you want to message is on the XMTP network. You can do this by calling client.canMessage with the address you want to message.

```jsx
//Message this XMTP message bot to get an immediate automated reply:
//gm.xmtp.eth (0x937C0d4a6294cdfa575de17382c7076b579DC176) env:production
const WALLET_TO = "0x20B572bE48527a770479744AeC6fE5644F97678B";
const isOnProdNetwork = await xmtp.canMessage(WALLET_TO);
console.log("Can message: " + isOnProdNetwork);
```

### Start a new conversation

You can create a new conversation with any EVM address activated on the XMTP network. For now we are only compatible with EVM wallets

```jsx
const conversation = await xmtp.conversations.newConversation(WALLET_TO);
console.log("Conversation created", conversation);
```

### Send a message

To send a message, the recipient must have already started their client at least once and consequently advertised their key bundle on the network.

```jsx
const message = await conversation.send("gm");
console.log("Message sent", message);
```

### Stream messages

You can receive the complete message history in all conversations.

```jsx
for await (const message of await xmtp.conversations.streamAllMessages()) {
  console.log(`New message from ${message.senderAddress}: ${message.content}`);
}
```

#### Need to send a test message?

Message this XMTP message bot to get an immediate automated reply:

- `gm.xmtp.eth`Â (`0x937C0d4a6294cdfa575de17382c7076b579DC176`)

#### Troubleshooting

If you get into issues with `Buffer` and `polyfills` check out our fix below:

1. Install buffer dependency

```bash
npm i buffer
```

2. Create a new file `polyfills.js` in the root of your project

```tsx
import { Buffer } from "buffer";

window.Buffer = window.Buffer ?? Buffer;
```

3. Import it into your main file on the first line

- ReacJS: `index.js` or `index.tsx`
- VueJS: `main.js`
- NuxtJS: `app.vue`

```tsx
import "./polyfills";
```

4. Update config files

- Webpack: `vue.config.js` or `webpack.config.js`:

```jsx
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],
      }),
    ],
  },
  transpileDependencies: true,
};
```

- Vite: `vite.config.js`:

```jsx
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { Buffer } from "buffer";

export default defineConfig({
  /**/
  define: {
    global: {
      Buffer: Buffer,
    },
  },
  /**/
});
```

- NuxtJS: `nuxt.config.js`:

```tsx
export default {
  build: {
    extend(config, { isClient }) {
      if (isClient) {
        config.node = {
          Buffer: true,
        };
      }
    },
  },
};
```
