:::info Open Frames

XMTP contributes to the Open Frames standard, fostering interoperability and open standards.

- [**Open Frames Spec**](https://github.com/open-frames/standard/blob/v0.0.1/README.md): Make Farcaster Frames interoperable.
- [**Awesome Open Frames**](https://github.com/open-frames/awesome-open-frames.git): Curated list of Open Frames compatible Frames.

## Third Party Tools

These tools already provide integration support interoperable Frames.

### Tooling

Third party frameworks and tooling who have already integrated XMTP signing into their offerings:

- [**OnChainKit**](https://onchainkit.xyz/xmtp/introduction): Discover how OnchainKit seamlessly incorporates XMTP payloads.
- [**Frames.js**](https://framesjs.org/reference/js/xmtp): Learn about the integration of XMTP payloads within FrameJS.
- [**Neynar**](https://warpcast.com/rish/0x6ee0f33b): Learn about the integration of XMTP payloads within FrameJS.

### Clients

Some clients are fully XMTP compatible and can render Frames signing XMTP payloads.

- [**Dev Inbox**](https://dev-inbox.vercel.app/): Engage with Frames firsthand by trying them on web.
- [**Converse**](https://converse.xyz): Converse is Frame compatible. Send your Frames through Converse.

## Getting started

These are the foundational tools that allow developers to create, sign, and manage Frames. The protocol libraries are essential for interacting with the XMTP network at a lower level, handling the creation of frames, signing payloads, and managing frame actions. Key aspects include:

- [**Declare Protocol Compatibility**](#protocol-compatibility): Ensure your application can interact with Frames by declaring protocol compatibility.
- [**Manage requests**](#manage-requests): Checks if a URL in message content is suitable for frame processing.
- [**Validate incoming messages**](#validate-incoming-messages): Implements security measures to authenticate and secure frame actions, ensuring the integrity and origin of frame interactions.
- [**Rendering Chat Frames in your application**](/docs/tutorials/render-frames): This tutorial covers the practical aspects of rendering these frames within an application.
- [**Exploring Chat Frames Use Cases**](/docs/use-cases/frames): Dive into a comprehensive exploration of how Frames can be innovatively applied across different sectors for inspiration.
