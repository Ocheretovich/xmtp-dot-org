### Introducing XMTP Frames

Make Frames interoperable and embed interactive experiences within your messaging apps:

**Ideas**:

- dApp integrations 🔌
- Fun and Games 🕹️
- Educational Tools 🛠
- Tipping & Commerce 💰

**Resources**:

- [Docs](https://xmtp.org/docs/use-cases/frames)
- [OnChainKit Docs](https://onchainkit.xyz/xmtpkit/introduction)
- [Try them on xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat/)

### Build token gated group chat with XMTP, Converse & Airstack

Exciting news! Token-gated group chats are now available on the Dev Network, ideal for NFT collections, ERC-20 token holders, and exclusive communities. These groups provide unique content and networking opportunities.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Set Up Your Group Chat**: Quickly deploy your group chat using our CLI.
2. **Create a Converse Link**: Easily share access to your group.
3. **Automate Membership with Airstack**: Use Airstack APIs for easy gatekeeping.

**Resources**:

- [Example app in React Native](https://github.com/xmtp-labs/xmtp-inbox-mobile)
- [React Native Quickstart](https://github.com/fabriguespe/xmtp-rn-quickstart)

### Universal Allow/Block Prefs

[XIP-42](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-42-universal-allow-and-block-preferences/544) establishes `allow` and `block` permission preferences, enabling users to explicitly specify which contacts should be able to reach them and which should be blocked across all inbox apps.

**Ideas**:

- Subscriptions: Opt into communications with a single click.
- Broadcasting: Send messages to multiple recipients.
- Request Inbox: Have full control over who can message you.
