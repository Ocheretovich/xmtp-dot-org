# Web3 social

[Lens Protocol ðŸŒ¿](https://docs.lens.xyz/) and [CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.hashnode.dev/) apps use XMTP to provide secure, private messaging to their users. Using web3 social media apps, also known as decentralized social, users are able to discover new friends and communicate with them.

#### Inspiration

- **Discovering new friends**: XMTP empowers Web3 social platforms to facilitate secure connections between users. Discovering new friends and building a network is made safer with encrypted communication.

- **Enhanced media communication**: Memes, attachments, and other media can be exchanged securely between users, fostering a rich and engaging social experience without compromising privacy.

NFT communities and creators are at the heart of the web3 social ecosystem, leveraging platforms to connect, collaborate, and share unique digital assets. XMTP plays a crucial role in enhancing these interactions with secure and private messaging. Here are some ways XMTP enriches the NFT community experience:

- **Exclusive Drops and Previews**: Creators can use XMTP to send encrypted messages to their followers about upcoming NFT drops or exclusive previews, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and secure.

- **Direct Engagement**: NFT creators can directly engage with their community members through secure channels. This direct line of communication helps in building a stronger community bond and provides a platform for receiving feedback.

- **Collaborative Projects**: XMTP enables creators and community members to collaborate on projects securely. Whether it's discussing ideas for a new NFT series or coordinating on a community-driven art project, encrypted messaging ensures that conversations remain private.

- **Marketplace Notifications**: Users can receive secure notifications about NFT listings, bids, and sales. This feature is particularly useful for keeping track of the fast-moving NFT market without compromising privacy.

- **Token-Gated Access**: Communities can leverage XMTP to create token-gated chat groups, where access is granted only to token or NFT holders. This creates an exclusive space for discussions, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), and community events.

- **Creator Support and Tipping**: XMTP facilitates secure transactions, allowing fans to support their favorite creators through tips or payments directly within the chat. This opens up new monetization avenues for creators.
