# Build messaging for CyberConnect profiles

This tutorial describes how to build with XMTP to provide messaging for [CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.hashnode.dev/) decentralized social media profiles (ccProfiles).

Specifically, the tutorial walks through how to integrate the [XMTP Inbox web app](https://github.com/xmtp-labs/xmtp-inbox-web) with CyberConnectâ€™s ccProfile and API to provide:

1. Address resolution through ccProfile handles, such as `ryan.cyber`

2. Conversation filters based on connection status, such as Following, Follower, and Connected

3. A Follow/Unfollow control for user conversations with ccProfile owners
