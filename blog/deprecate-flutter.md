# We're Deprecating the Flutter SDK

We have made the difficult decision to deprecate the Flutter SDK as we aim to streamline XMTP's focus. This decision wasn't made lightly, but after careful consideration of our resources, priorities, and the impact on our developer community.

### Why Deprecate the Flutter SDK?

The Flutter SDK has become a significant drain on our resources without contributing substantially to our mission. Unfortunately, the SDK currently supports few active users. Our goal at XMTP is to deliver the most robust, secure, and versatile messaging protocol for the web3 ecosystem. To achieve this, we must focus our efforts where they matter most.

### Our Deprecation Plan

Here's how we plan to phase out the Flutter SDK:

- **Effective Immediately**: All development and updates for the Flutter SDK will cease, except for any critical bug fixes already in progress.
- **Support Until August 2024**: The SDK will continue to support direct messaging (DMs) until the rollout of MLS DMs, our next-generation messaging protocol. We're optimistic about launching MLS DMs by August 2024.
- **Deprecation Notices**: We will add clear deprecation warnings to the Flutter SDK's README file, the package description, and our documentation. These notices will inform users of the SDK's status, the cessation of updates, and the target removal date of August 2024.
- **Removal**: Just before the launch of MLS DMs, we will completely remove the Flutter SDK from our repositories and documentation.

### Moving Forward

We understand that this decision may come as a disappointment to some of our developers and community members. Still, we want to assure you that it's in the best interest of focusing our resources on developing features and improvements that will benefit the broader XMTP ecosystem. We're grateful for your continued support and understanding and remain committed to building a more connected and secure web3 world together.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us.
