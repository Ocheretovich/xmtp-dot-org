# Roadmap

Here are a few details about what's in store for XMTP in the months ahead.

## In progress

### React Native client support

Developers will be able to build client apps in React Native.

### Network decentralization milestones

XMTP Labs will specify a phased approach towards architectural and logical decentralization of the network.

## Planned

### Message any address

Individuals will be able to send encrypted DMs and announcements to addresses that have not yet created XMTP identities. Recipients will be notified of these messages upon first connection to XMTP and will be able to retrieve them if the sender is online or has specified a secure key server.

### Team inboxes

Teams will be able to read and send encrypted DMs and announcements using a shared team identity that resolves to their ENS domain or Lens profile. The account admin will be able to delegate access to and revoke access from individual team user accounts.

Team identities will be capable of messaging any address.

### Compromise recovery

Users will be able to recover their compromised XMTP identity by creating new private keys.

### App permissions

Users will be able to grant explicit permission for an app to use their account across sessions and will be able to revoke this permission at any time.

### Push notifications and webhooks

Users will be able to grant apps permission to notify them externally when new messages are received.

### Participant privacy

Network clients responsible for relaying and storing messages will no longer be able to observe the addresses of participants in ongoing conversations.

### Group chat and announcements channels

Users will be able to send messages to group chats and announcements channels, and will retrieve messages from these channels separately from their DMs.

### Secure key storage alternatives

Users will be able to store XMTP private keys in secure contexts such as wallet apps.

### Swift, Kotlin client support

Developers will be able to build client apps in Swift and Kotlin.
